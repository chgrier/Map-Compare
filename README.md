# Map-Compare
An iOS app that allows the user to compare Mapbox Mobile maps with native Apple Maps in one view. 

In order for the app to work, you must install Mapbox GL to the project.  To install using Cocoapods, follow the directions on the Mapbox website: https://www.mapbox.com/guides/first-steps-gl-ios/#cocoapods

Also, you must enter your Mapbox Access Token (see warning directive).
